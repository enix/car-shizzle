# car shizzle

yeah... this is just me looking for a new used car.

The package scrapes autotrader.nl data (look at the source to configure) and can plot various graphs to get a better grasp at the current market. Useful when you're not a big car buff but it can also provides some interesting insights for the more petrol savvy.

## install & run

In the `scraper` folder run

    npm install
    npm start

In the `site` folder run

    npm install
    bower install
    npm start

## hack

Calling changing your car preferences 'configuring' would be overselling the current state of the code :)

Take a look at the `scrape` code to change you favourite car and model. Also don't forget the color mapping table in the `site`.

Have fun, and keep in mind that autotrader.nl owns the data, not you or me.
